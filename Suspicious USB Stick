Scenario
Scenario
One of our clients informed us they recently suffered an employee data breach. As a startup company, they had a constrained budget allocated for security and employee training. I visited them and spoke with the relevant stakeholders. I also collected some suspicious emails and a USB drive an employee found on their premises. While I am analyzing the suspicious emails, can you check the contents on the USB drive?
